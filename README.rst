rhdndat: romhacking.net_ dat creator and update checker
=======================================================

.. _romhacking.net: http://www.romhacking.net


**rhdndat** finds triples ``(rom file, softpatch file, version file)`` on the same directory and creates a clrmamepro entry on stdout or file for the result of each softpatch. It can also serve as a notifier that a update is required by comparing local versions to remote romhacking.net versions.

| A softpatch filename is:
| ``rom filename - rom extension + patch extension`` or
| ``rom filename - rom extension + .reset.xdelta`` 

This last is a special case to recognize hardpatched roms with revert patches.

If there is no patch file, but a version file exists, and the extension matches, the file will be assumed to be hardpatched, which can be avoided by passing ``-i``.

version file is simply named ``version`` and has a version number line followed by a romhacking.net url line, repeated. These correspond to each hack or translation on the softpatch.

Requires flips (if trying to work with ips, bps) and xdelta3 (if trying to work with xdelta) on path or the same directory.

Arguments:
----------

**rhdndat** [-h] [-o **output-file**] [-o **merge-file**] [-d **xml-file**] [-i] [-x] [-t] **search-path** **rom-type**

positional arguments:
  -search-path     directory tree to search for (rom, patches and version) files

                    if there is no (rom, romfilename patch) pair but a patch of 
                    the form 'romfilename.reset.xdelta' is found, rom is treated
                    as a hardpatched rom, -d will search for the checksum of the
                    original rom and the output will be the checksums of 'rom'

                    if (rom, version) pair exists, but no patch, rom is treated
                    as hardpatched and printed unless -i is given

  -rom-type        extension (without dot) of roms to find patches for

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -o output-file  ouput file, if ommited writes to stdout
  -m merge-file   merge non-overriden entries from this source file
                  to override a entry, a new entry must list the same
                  romhacking urls as the older entry

  -d xml-file     picks up the game names from from this cmpro .xml and the
                  rom checksum (including if a revert patch is available),
                  if no entry is found the program picks names from the
                  romhacking.net hack page

  -i              don't allow unrecognized roms to be added even if the patches
                  have a romhacking.net hack page, requires -d

  -x              for all roms, store user.rom.md5, user.rom.crc32 and
                  user.rom.sha1 as extended attributes in the rom file,
                  requires nothing but a rom but if a patch of the same
                  name exists, it'll consider it a softpatch and record
                  the checksums as if the patch was applied

  -t              only test version numbers against remote version,
                  works without a patch present, exclusive option

Memory Requirements
-------------------

This tool uses named FIFO files to calculate checksums when it has to patch, so not much memory is consumed. However, for patches of large roms like isos, you should make sure you're using xdelta instead of bps, because flips tries to read the whole file into memory to create or apply a patch.

Install
-------

rhdndat requires python 3.5 or later.

`The source for this project is available here
<https://github.com/i30817/rhdndat>`_.


The project can be installed on recent linux machines with pip3 by installing rhdndat from [PyPI]_ or installing latest master from [github]_ but you'll have to provide your own flips and xdelta executables in path (or current dir) for the ips, bps and xdelta support. That depends on your distribution but you can get and build them on the sites at the end of the document.


.. [PyPI] ``pip3 install --user rhdndat``
.. [github] ``pip3 install --user https://github.com/i30817/rhdndat/archive/master.zip``

rhdndat may fail to execute if your OS doesn't add the pip3 install dir ``~/.local/bin`` - in linux - to the path
